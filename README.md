# Stocks coding challenge

## How to run the application

There are two apps: `stocks` and `stocks-api`.

- `stocks` is the front-end. It uses Angular 7 and Material. You can run this using `yarn serve:stocks`
- `stocks-api` uses Hapi and has a very minimal implementation. You can start the API server with `yarn serve:stocks-api`

A proxy has been set up in `stocks` to proxy calls to `locahost:3333` which is the port that the Hapi server listens on.

> You need to register for a token here: https://iexcloud.io/cloud-login#/register/ Use this token in the `environment.ts` file for the `stocks` app.

> The charting library is the Google charts API: https://developers.google.com/chart/

## Problem statement

[Original problem statement](https://github.com/tmobile/developer-kata/blob/master/puzzles/web-api/stock-broker.md)

### Task 1

Please provide a short code review of the base `master` branch:

#### Task 1-A
1. What is done well?
2. What would you change?
3. Are there any code smells or problematic implementations?

> Make a PR to fix at least one of the issues that you identify

#### Task 1-B

[Accessability](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/) is an important feature of all public facing websites.  

> Make a PR to add accessability features to the web application


### Task 2

```
Business requirement: As a user I should be able to type into
the symbol field and make a valid time-frame selection so that
the graph is refreshed automatically without needing to click a button.
```

_**Make a PR from the branch `feat_stock_typeahead` to `master` and provide a code review on this PR**_



> Add comments to the PR. Focus on all items that you can see - this is a hypothetical example but let's treat it as a critical application. Then present these changes as another commit on the PR.
PR is created and comments have been added in the pull request. Please refer to commnets for all the task solution


### Task 3

```
Business requirement: As a user I want to choose custom dates
so that I can view the trends within a specific period of time.
```

_**Implement this feature and make a PR from the branch `feat_custom_dates` to `master`.**_

> Use the material date-picker component

> We need two date-pickers: "from" and "to". The date-pickers should not allow selection of dates after the current day. "to" cannot be before "from" (selecting an invalid range should make both dates the same value)

### Task 4

```
Technical requirement: the server `stocks-api` should be used as a proxy
to make calls. Calls should be cached in memory to avoid querying for the
same data. If a query is not in cache we should call-through to the API.
```

_**Implement the solution and make a PR from the branch `feat_proxy_server` to `master`**_

> It is important to get the implementation working before trying to organize and clean it up.
